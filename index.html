            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! My name is Keven Benitez and I am a student currently enrolled in the UCLA Coding Bootcamp program, where I am learning the ins and outs of full stack web development.

I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and the way it has transformed the way we live and work. I decided to pursue a career in web development because I believe it offers endless opportunities to create innovative solutions that can help people in their everyday lives.

In the UCLA Coding Bootcamp, I am gaining hands-on experience with all aspects of web development, from front-end design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to back-end development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am also learning how to use popular web development frameworks like React and Redux.

The program is challenging, but incredibly rewarding. I am constantly pushing myself to learn new skills and tackle complex problems, and I am excited to see how far I can go.

                        The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
